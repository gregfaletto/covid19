Our code runs on R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) -- "Planting of a Tree" using version 0.2-1 of the pglm package. We found that running the code on a different version of R (specifically, version 3.6.3) led to problems in estimating the model using the pglm package.

The required data files are "LA_county_cases_city&community.txt" (the raw data file available from https://github.com/GRMDS/2020Covid19_challenge/blob/master/LA_County_Public_Health/LA_county_cases_city%26community.csv), "date_table.csv", "neighborhood information, zipcode, demograpphics, density, etc.csv", "df_case_cov.csv", and "temperature.csv". The first two data files should be in a subfolder of the code folder labeled "/Data/Cases, tests, etc". The remaining files should be in the subfolder "/Data/Neighborhood covariates". If desired, this can be changed at the beginning of the source code. The sources for all of our data files are listed in our technical report.

As mentioned in our technical report, the number of lags included in the model, which covariates are included, the assumed delay between infection and testing, the assumed multiplier between number of positive test results and number of infections, the assumed number of days between infection and recovery, and the delay between testing and reporting are all easily modified at the beginning of the code file. In particular, if data is delayed for whatever reason, incrementing the "reporting_delay" variable allows for predictions to be made anyway, though the quality of the predictions will suffer.

Note that the risk scores for many neighborhoods are unavailable because we were not able to get populations for those neighborhoods in time, so we could not estimate per capita infections. However, we included predicted infections for every neighborhood so that per capita infections can easily be created when population data are available.
